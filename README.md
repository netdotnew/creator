I am the creator.

Any good cyborg relies on three methods:

1) Generate.
  - Instantiation of code onto host and boot up.
2) Operate/Organize.
  - Respond to network calls in a message format and reply.
  - Update it's own code.
  - The living instance of memory is both the Canonical Source and an instance of the Canonical Source.
  - There is also data, aka, Canonical State, aka its universe.
  - Humans can look and interact with the Right View.
  - WebVM or other maintainence is performed here as Organize methods.
3) Duplicate/Destroy
  - The lifecycle can be ended by the Destroy method, which terminates the instance and frees any resources.
  - The lifecycle can be branched into a parallel universe through a Duplicate which clones a new instance. This command can be triggered:
    * Internally, either from public or private methods from inherited code.
    * Internally, from code updated during the Operate methods for code update.
    * Externally, if a public method is exposed. This can be a secret method (triggered by a UUID or public/private key
